# Important to know about the gas and fees:
#
# fees = (gas * gas-prices) as per Cosmos SDK docs.
# (200000 * 0.025uakt) = 5000uakt floor fee for most of RPC nodes.
#
# Akash RPC nodes set --minimum-gas-prices=0.025uakt which gives
# 5000uakt minimum fee when multiplied by the gas price (200000 default).
#
# Akash clients should respect this and set --gas-prices to 0.025uakt
#
# Note that RPC node running without minimum-gas-prices set will accept
# 0uakt fee transactions which is not desirable as per Cosmos SDK docs.
#
# --gas argument works only when --gas-prices is set!
# Note that the clients cannot provide both fees and gas prices!
#
# Anything you set here will get globally exposed via AKASH_GAS_PRICES,
# AKASH_GAS, AKASH_GAS_ADJUSTMENT environment variables in
# charts/akash-provider/templates/deployment.yaml
gasprices: "0.025uakt"
# set --gas to 200000 (or higher) to meet Akash RPC's minimum fees, (--minimum-gas-prices X 200000) = 5000uakt.
# or set --gas to "auto" to leverage the gasadjustment setting;
# increase gasadjustment to tackle "out of gas" issues, i.e. https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/issues/1508
gas: "auto"
# Note that --gas-adjustment is working only when --gas is "auto"!

#  monitor
##

# These monitor settings control the retry behavior for deployment checks and health monitoring.
#
# If a user deployment cannot start for any reason - such as an issue with the deployment itself,
# a provider issue (e.g., a lost node due to disk or networking failure), or scheduled maintenance -
# this monitor starts a counter for retry attempts. It determines how many times and how frequently
# the provider will retry before marking the deployment as failed and closing the lease.
#
# With the default settings (maxRetries = 40, retryPeriod = 4s, retryPeriodJitter = 15s), the total retry time is ~8 minutes.
#
# Setting maxRetries to 0 will immediately deem the deployment as failed without attempting any retries.
#
# Formula: Total Time = maxRetries * (retryPeriod + average retryPeriodJitter)
# Example for 1 hour (3600 seconds): maxRetries = 3600 / (retryPeriod + average retryPeriodJitter)
# Example for 24 hours (86400 seconds): maxRetries = 86400 / (retryPeriod + average retryPeriodJitter)
# Example for 48 hours (172800 seconds): maxRetries = 172800 / (retryPeriod + average retryPeriodJitter)

# Defaults: retryPeriod = 4s, retryPeriodJitter = 15s, average retryPeriodJitter = 7.5s
# Example for 1 hour: maxRetries = 3600 / (4 + 7.5) = 3600 / 11.5 ≈ 313
# Example for 24 hours: maxRetries = 86400 / (4 + 7.5) = 86400 / 11.5 ≈ 7513
# Example for 48 hours: maxRetries = 172800 / (4 + 7.5) = 172800 / 11.5 ≈ 15026
